# Inspiration

Atlanta has a problem in terms of crime. For a newcomer to Atlanta, it might not be as clear as to where to visit during what times and what neighborhoods should be avoided at certain times. Although most of the problems have significantly reduced in the past of couple of years, when it comes to crime any number that's above 0 is too much.

Thus we've decided to make it better represented. A system that would allow you to pinpoint what parts of the city are good to go, and what time/day would be most suitable at what neighborhoods.

# What is does 

notimeforcrime.tech or colloquially atlanta crime statistics is a web application that provides you with the analysis of the entire Metro Atlanta area. It uses datasets gathered from the Atlanta Police Departments' website and creates a visual representation of all the crime that has occured in the area in the past 13 years. 

# Key Features

- Being able to sort through the entire dataset of more than 40,000 incidents of crime, in a relatively fast way.
- Sort by one crime, or multiple types of crime by selection. 
- Sort by hour and time and crime distributions per hour and day.
- A visual representation (Heatmap) at the exact location of the crime that occured. 

# How we built it

- It uses pandas to sort through all of the dataset and bring the dataset for Plotly to visualize all of the data in a way that is visually appealing and understandable. 
-  Using Streamlit, we then represent this in a modern interface which allows for cross-platform functionality.
